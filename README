Hi, and welcome to my GitHub.

I have my crossword generator, and a simple MineField game uploaded to Github for your perusings. 
For most of the detail work in the crossword simulator, you can see Board.py

Please note that I have implemented an app as a beta right now in Swift and in Java that features these puzzles but I cannot
display that as that is most definitely proprietary. Additionally, my work on Memory, a software that helps people remember
facts important to them, is an important part of my past work but that too is Patent Pending and therefore proprietary.
